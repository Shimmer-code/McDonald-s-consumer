对麦当劳消费者数据进行了系统分析，首先通过数据预处理将文本型评分和分类变量转换为数值型数据并标准化，然后创新性地采用两步聚类法（预聚类+层次聚类）将消费者分为3个典型群体，利用PCA降维可视化聚类效果。项目通过丰富的可视化图表（包括堆叠条形图、箱线图、热力图等）深入分析了不同消费群体在食品属性认知、人口统计特征和行为习惯上的差异，并计算了各变量间的斯皮尔曼相关系数以揭示潜在关联，最终全面刻画了麦当劳消费者画像，为精准营销和产品优化提供了数据支撑。

Conducted a systematic analysis of McDonald's consumer data. The project began with data preprocessing, converting text-based ratings and categorical variables into numerical format and standardizing the data. An innovative two-step clustering method (pre-clustering followed by hierarchical clustering) was employed to segment consumers into three distinct groups. PCA was used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the clustering results.

A wide range of visualizations—including stacked bar charts, box plots, and heatmaps—were used to deeply explore differences among consumer groups in terms of food attribute perceptions, demographic characteristics, and behavioral habits. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to reveal potential relationships between variables. The project ultimately provided a comprehensive portrait of McDonald's consumers, offering data-driven insights to support targeted marketing and product optimization.
